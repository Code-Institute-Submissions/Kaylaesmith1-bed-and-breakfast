#### User stories not yet implemented -- ARE THERE ANY ??

The following user stories were not included within the scope of Portfolio Project 4. They are intended to be implemented in the future.

### Design -- DONE

The website design is set in simple, paragraph form, which is intended to make it easier for the reader to navigate. The navigation bar is clear on each page, as is the footer and the pages are labelled with a 'banner' format thus ensuring users know where they are at all times. 


The color scheme was chosen to reflect a 'red wine' color and incorporate rich, earthy tones to encompass the vineyard theme.


#### Color Scheme -- DONE
The color palette was created using the palette generator [Coolers](https://coolors.co/).


The background of all site pages is the lightest color, a shade of beige, alowing for a stark contrast with the burgundy color when used as an accent. Shades of the green are used to accent other pages or as background for text or as a hover color. The darker beige color was used mainly as a visual cue to the user when links or buttons were hovered over.


All combinations of the colors used illustrate a contrast between background and text to ensure maximum user accessibility.


![Color Palette](/documentation/readme_images/color-palette.png)


#### Imagery -- DONE
Two different static images are included on the site depicting a homestead in a vineyard. Other images are used as the banner backgrounds on the About, Contact Us and Menu pages.
 

#### Fonts -- DONE
The 'Quicksand' font is the main font used on the page, while 'Montserrat' in a bolder weight was used for the navbar and 'Kanit' for other accent areas. The 'Sans-serif' font is noted as a backup and will be used in the event that the main fonts aren't imported correctly to the site. These font style were chosen for their ease of legibility and general letter spacing and were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## Agile Methodology -- DONE

The agile methodology was used throughout project development. EPICS, user stories and the steps of the process are shown on [GitHub projects](https://github.com/users/Kaylaesmith1/projects/2/views/1).

In total, there were 8 EPICs that encompassed all user stories, depending on subject matter. Each user story was created as an 'issue' that outlined the goal to implement and the acceptance criteria. Once these criteria were developed and met, the user story moved through the process to the 'done' column. When all user stories specfic to an EPIC were completed, the EPIC itself was moved to the 'done' column. 

Creating EPICs and user stories for this project facilitated a smooth working environment where both general and specific goals were visualized, more easily tackled and brought to fruition. 

## Data Model -- FINISH THIS W NEW MODELS
I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views. Django AllAuth was used for user authentication.

A custom Menu model was made to incorporate CRUD functionality for admin users. This allows logged in, admin users to add, edit or delete a menu item, both from the live site and from the Django admin page.

The Customer model displays a working contact form on the Contact Us page. [Email js](https://www.emailjs.com/) was also used to ensure queries are addressed. For the purpose of this project, the emails arrive in my personal inbox.


The diagram below details the database schema.

![Database Schema]() -- IS NECESSARY?

## Testing

Details of all testing done can be viewed in depth in the [TESTING.md](https://github.com/Kaylaesmith1/bed-and-breakfast/blob/main/TESTING.md) documentation.
## Security Features and Defensive Design - DO THIS

### User Authentication - DONE

- Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to ensure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated or, in some cases, non-admin users, are redirected to the login page. 


### Form Validation - DONE
All fields in the contact form are required. If a user attempts to submit the form without filling in all fields, a warning text will appear at the bottom of the form asking them to complete the fields. The form will not submit until all fields are filled in. Once this is done, a message will pop up that the form was submitted successfully.

### Database Security - DONE
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database. The env.py file was created before the initial push to GitHub.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site, barring the contact form.

### Custom error pages: DONE

Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

- 404 Page Not Found - "Sorry! The page you're looking for doesn't exist. Click below to return to the homepage." Below, there is a clickable button that will take the user back to the home page.
- 500 Server Error - "Sorry! The Wine Garden BnB can't handle this request at the moment. Please return to the home page." Below this, there is a button that will take the user back to the home page.

- As a Site User, I can search and filter recipes so that I can find the one I want.
Searching and filtering

Other potential features include:
- Adding extra categories on the Meal Plan Item for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks so the user can plan out their meals for the full day rather than just for dinner.
- Adding vegan and vegetarian labels to the recipe so the user can filter by these options.

- Copy the DATABASE_URL located in Config Vars in the Settings Tab.

### Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
- In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file. 
- Update the settings.py file to import the env.py file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
- Comment out the default database configuration.
- Save files and make migrations.
- Add Cloudinary URL to env.py

- Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku.
- Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

### Create files / directories
- Create requirements.txt file
- Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage and templates.

### Update Heroku Config Vars
Add the following Config Vars in Heroku:
- SECRET_KEY value 
- CLOUDINARY_URL
- PORT = 8000
- DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
