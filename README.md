### Design

The website design is set in simple, paragraph form, which is intended to make it easier for the reader to navigate. The navigation bar is clear on each page, as is the footer and the pages are labelled with a 'banner' format thus ensuring users know where they are at all times. 


The color scheme was chosen to reflect a 'red wine' color and incorporate rich, earthy tones to encompass the vineyard theme.


#### Color Scheme
The color palette was created using the palette generator [Coolers](https://coolors.co/).


The background of all site pages is the lightest color, a shade of beige, alowing for a stark contrast with the burgundy color when used as an accent. Shades of the green are used to accent other pages or as background for text or as a hover color. The darker beige color was used mainly as a visual cue to the user when links or buttons were hovered over.


All combinations of the colors used illustrate a contrast between background and text to ensure maximum user accessibility.


![Color Palette](/documentation/readme_images/color-palette.png)


#### Imagery
Two different static images are included on the site depicting a homestead in a vineyard. Other images are used as the banner backgrounds on the About, Contact Us and Menu pages.
 

#### Fonts
The 'Quicksand' font is the main font used on the page, while 'Montserrat' in a bolder weight was used for the navbar and 'Kanit' for other accent areas. The 'Sans-serif' font is noted as a backup and will be used in the event that the main fonts aren't imported correctly to the site. These font style were chosen for their ease of legibility and general letter spacing and were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## Agile Methodology

The agile methodology was used throughout project development. EPICS, user stories and the steps of the process are shown on [GitHub projects](https://github.com/users/Kaylaesmith1/projects/2/views/1).

In total, there were eight EPICs that encompassed all user stories, depending on subject matter. Each user story was created as an 'issue' that outlined the goal to implement and the acceptance criteria. Once these criteria were developed and met, the user story moved through the process to the 'done' column. When all user stories specfic to an EPIC were completed, the EPIC itself was moved to the 'done' column. 

Creating EPICs and user stories for this project facilitated a smooth working environment where both general and specific goals were visualized, more easily tackled and brought to fruition. 

## Data Model
I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Django’s Class-Based Generic Views. Django AllAuth was used for user authentication.

The Customer model displays a working contact form on the Contact Us page. [Email js](https://www.emailjs.com/) was also used to ensure queries are addressed. For the purpose of this project, the emails arrive in my personal inbox.

A custom Menu model was made to incorporate CRUD functionality for admin superusers. This allows logged in, admin users to add, edit or delete a menu item, both from the live site and from the Django database via the Django admin page.

The Item model displays all menu items in the six chosen categories. The required fields are the name of the item, a slug field and a description.

The Room model has a list of the two rooms available to book, either the Master Bedroom or the Queen Bedroom. Logged in users can select one via a dropdown menu in the booking form on the Book A Room page.

The Booking model is for the user to select the room, check in and check out dates. They are unable to select the user on the form. Once the room is booked, the user is the logged in person by default.


## Testing

Details of all testing done can be viewed in depth in the [TESTING.md](https://github.com/Kaylaesmith1/bed-and-breakfast/blob/main/TESTING.md) document.

## Database Design
An Entity Relationship Diagram was created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to better visualize the relationships of variables between data structures. 

Django-AllAuth was implemented for user authentication.

Models dealing with menu items allow the superuser all CRUD functionality.

Models dealing with booking a room use a ForeignKey for the user and room selection.

![Database Schema](/documentation/readme_images/database-schema.png)

## Security Features and Defensive Design

### User Authentication

- Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to ensure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated or, in some cases, non-admin users, are redirected to the login page. 


### Form Validation
- All fields in the contact form are required. If a user attempts to submit the form without filling in all fields, a warning text will appear at the bottom of the form asking them to complete the fields. The form will not submit until all fields are filled in. Once this is done, a message will pop up that the form was submitted successfully.

### Database Security
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database. The env.py file was created before the initial push to GitHub.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site, barring the contact form.

### Custom error pages

Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

- 404 Page Not Found - "Sorry! The page you're looking for doesn't exist. Click below to return to the homepage." Below, there is a clickable button that will take the user back to the home page.
- 500 Server Error - "Sorry! The Wine Garden BnB can't handle this request at the moment. Please return to the home page." Below this, there is a button that will take the user back to the home page.

### Future Features
A few features were thought about mid-project as aspects that could improve the UI/UX but that were not implemented in this version of the project, either due to time contraints or simply because they were suggestions from friends / family members during the final testing phase of the project.

None were original user stories and were therefore not included anywhere in the project other than in this section. They are detailed below.

1. Email authentication for users on signing up. This would add another layer of authentication for users and would be an improvement on the overall website. 
2. Have something on the My Bookings page even if you don’t have any bookings registered. As of now it's a page titled 'My bookings' but nothing is shown.
![Empty bookings](/documentation/readme_images/empty-bookings.png)
3. Incorporate a payment option, rates and pricing for booking. This is normally a feature of online hotel booking platforms. Taking credit card information could be a helpful aspect to implement in the future.
4. Add photos of menu items or some food items on the breakfast page. Perhaps clicking the menu item could open a photo of it and a description of ingredients in case the user had questions of what exactly it was.
5. If a user cancels a booking, a pop up should appear with checkboxes as to why they cancelled. This could also be a form with a textarea field to be more specific.
6. Perhaps include a 'Book Now' button somewhere no each page of the website to facilitate easy booking.
7. The Admin user has access to all bookings from the live site. As of now, each user has access only to their bookings from the live website. It could be helpful for the Admin superuser to be able to access everyone's bookings and have CRUD functionality on them.

## Deployment - Heroku

The following steps were taken to deploy the live website to Heroku from the GitHub repository:

### Create a Heroku App:
- Log into your [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) account or create an account.

### Attach the Postgres database:
- In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.
- Copy the DATABASE_URL located in Config Vars in the Settings Tab.

### Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
- In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file. 
- Update the settings.py file to import the env.py file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
- Comment out the default database configuration.
- Save all files and make migrations.
- Add the Cloudinary URL to env.py
- Add the Cloudinary libraries to the list of installed apps.
- Add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url and default file storage path.
- Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku.
- Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

### Create files / directories
- Create a requirements.txt file
- Create directories in the main directory; media, static and templates.
- Create a "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following: web: gunicorn project_name.wsgi
- Make sure the Procfile is capitalized and only has one line.

### Update Heroku Config Vars
Add the following Config Vars in Heroku:
- SECRET_KEY value 
- CLOUDINARY_URL
- PORT = 8000
- DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the tutoring team, specifically Joshua who helped with the contact form, Sarah who helped with implementing CRUD functionality on the live site, and Oisin who helped fix the bug of being able to book a room under a different user.

Ian_alumni from the slack channel was vital to my understanding of the pathway followed for my delete buttons and getting them to work correctly. He spent time in a call with me clarifying the urls and views pathways. Thank you, Ian!

Lastly, thank you, too, to my mentor Harry for sharing his project and ideas about CRUD functionality. He gave clear, concise feedback on what needed to be fixed before project submission and complemented the work overall.
