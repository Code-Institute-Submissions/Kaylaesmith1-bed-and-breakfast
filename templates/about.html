        <!-- <p class="card-title text-center">ABOUT INFO</p> -->
        <p class="about-card">Welcome to The Wine Garden BnB, located in the heart of the Midwest. Situated on 80 acres of farmland, the
          house features three spacious bedrooms that provide a more intimate experience. There is a grill and outdoor
          patio, great for dining in the open air. If your desire is to escape city life and enjoy the countryside, we
          have several trails winding through our 30 acre hardwood forest that lead to our pond and vineyard. There you
          can enjoy a swim or picnic in the gazebo next to the grape vines.</p>
